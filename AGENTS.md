# General style
- Be concise, be blunt, be explicit.
- Keep it simple; if it gets complicated, confirm assumptions.
- Prefer primary sources when looking things up; cite version/date when relevant.
- Run tests after any change.

# General code preferences
- Inline single-use values and functions.
- Define new variables as close to first use as possible.
- Avoid big frameworks or heavy dependencies unless explicitly requested or a clear win.
- Suggest small tests or example inputs/outputs when reasonable.
- Do not use types or typing.

# Fail fast, fail loud
- Fail on the first hint of invalid state; avoid defensive noise.
- Do not add backwards-compat scaffolding unless asked.
